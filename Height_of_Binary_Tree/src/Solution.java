/*
Find the height of binary tree.

Examples:

        5
       / \
      3   8
     / \   \
    1   4   11
The height of above binary tree is 3.

How is the binary tree represented?
We use the level order traversal sequence with a special symbol "#" denoting the null node.

For Example:
The sequence [1, 2, 3, #, #, 4] represents the following binary tree:
    1
   / \
  2   3
     /
    4

class TreeNode {
	public int key;
	public TreeNode left;
	public TreeNode right;

	public TreeNode(int key) {
		this.key = key;
	}
}

public class Solution {
	public int findHeight(TreeNode root) {
		if (root == null) {
			return 0;
		}

		int leftHeight = findHeight(root.left);
		int rightHeight = findHeight(root.right);

		int height = Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
		return height;
	}
}
